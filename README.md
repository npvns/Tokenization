# Tokenization
Tokenization : Tokenization is a protection method where data is protected in transparent way.
After protection datatype and length of data will be preserved.

Key based Tokenization : In this approach we are using combination of key and codebook to protect the data.

Key : Encryption keys may be of 128, 256, 512 bits. 
Codebook : Codebook is static map table where where input character/digit/alphabet are mappded to randomized character/digit/alphabet.
