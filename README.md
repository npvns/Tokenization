# Tokenization
Benefit of Key based tokenization
=================================
Tokenization : Tokenization is a protection method where data is protected in transparent way. After protection datatype and length of data will be preserved.

Key based Tokenization : In this approach we are using combination of "key and codebook" to protect the data.

Key : Encryption keys may be of 128, 256, 512 bits. 
Codebook : Codebook is static map table where where input character/digit/alphabet are mappded to randomized character/digit/alphabet.

Security : Combination of "codebook and key" making the algorithm more secure. Even if codebook is kept open, it is as secure as ekncryption methods. Unless you know the key, you can not use the codebook in right way.

Scalable : Codebook is a constant entity. But when it's
